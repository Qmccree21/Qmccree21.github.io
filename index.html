  <main>Short Bio<br><br>
    <p> My name is Quenten McCree, im 20 years old and live in San Antonio, Texas.<br> I am very excited to step into
      coding for the very first time, and hopefully gain a career out of it!</p> 
     <h3> Heres a little more about me</h3>
    <p> I work at amazon SAT1 right now, I love playing video games, driving my sports car(a Subaru WRX), and playing basketball 
      with the bros. How can I forget, I also love making that MONEY! Im sure im journey into coding will take a while and be very difficult
      however I have only one option which is to succeed! I'm a strong believer in the saying "you can acomplish anything as long as yo put 
      your mind to it". <br>This quote has inspired me all the way from middle and high school football, to participating in this software 
      development program. <br>Coding is one of those things that is very difficult and complex at times yet remaining enjoyable as you solve hard 
      problems and get a sense of accomplishment out of doing so. I cant wait to tell everyone about my journey into software development from 
      start to finish!

  <h3>My Feelings towards Coding</h3>
  <p>I have always been hesitant with taking up hobbies/ potential jobs that people say are hard such as Engineering,
    Software Devlopment, police academy etc. I still carry some of that same hesitence even today as I still struggle with
    procrastination in this program. Its like a part of me (the lazy part) doesnt want to do it, while the other part 
    is always super excited to join the zoom meetings for lessons and finishing projects. Nevertheless this is fun!

  <h3>What the future entails</h3>
  <p>This part is hard only because theres so many possible routes I could go down to advance my career  in software development.
    My ideal job would to work from home, im an introvert so also solo work so not so much team/group stuff, and also a big pay check.

  <h3>Who and What Inspiers Me</h3>
   <p> J.Cole, Russle Wilson, Kyrie Irvine. Those 3 men had such an impact on who i am today. Teaching me to 
     remain humble when winning, and trusting myself through the adversity. I see much success from these learnings as 
     I feel like this program is offering me such a great oppertunity that I MUST take advantage of, no matter how 
     hard it may get.<br><br>
